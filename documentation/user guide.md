# User Guide to Lucid Math

Using Lucid Math is simple: install it in your browser, then visit any page that contains MathML. The extension will automatically scan the page and convert MathML into plaintext.

The original MathML remains intact. Right below it, you’ll see your result starting with the phrase “Plaintext:”, followed by the converted output.

To get the most out of Lucid Math, you’ll want to be familiar with the symbols it uses in plaintext.

## Plaintext Math Symbols

- +, -, \*, and / represent addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Their Unicode variants (+, −, ×, ÷) may also appear.

- Although / is a division symbol, Lucid Math uses it specifically to represent fractions.

- Grouping symbols include parentheses (), brackets \[], and braces {}.

- Relational symbols: <, >, ≤, ≥, =

- Absolute value symbol: |

- Exponent symbol: ^

- Subscript symbol: \_

These cover the most important symbols for algebra. As you move into higher-level math, you’ll encounter more, but these basics will take you a long way.

## Example Output

Here are some examples to show how Lucid Math presents math in plaintext.

- Division of whole numbers:

Plaintext: 64 ÷ 8

As noted earlier, every output begins with “Plaintext:” to clearly separate it from the original MathML. (This prefix may change in future versions based on user feedback.)

- Long division:

Plaintext: 4 long division of (12)

Sometimes, Lucid Math uses words instead of symbols. This is because not every mathematical symbol maps neatly to plaintext, and words are often clearer and more accessible.

- Addition and subtraction:

Plaintext: 7 + 1

Plaintext: 8 − 1

Simple and direct.

- Multiplication:

Plaintext: 3 × 8

Sometimes multiplication appears differently:

Plaintext: 3 · 8

Plaintext: 3 (8)

All of these mean the same thing: 3 multiplied by 8.

- Equations:

Plaintext: x + 8 = 17

Plaintext: 2 x − 5 = −13

- Fractions:

Plaintext: 6/8

Plaintext: 2/5

- Grouping with multiple symbols:

Plaintext: 8 (14 − 8) 21 − 3 \[ 2 + 4 (9 − 8) ] 24 ÷ { 13 − 2 \[ 1 (6 − 5) + 4 ] }


## What Lucid Math Cannot Do

It’s just as important to know what Lucid Math does not do:

- No calculations. Lucid Math only converts MathML into readable plaintext. It will not solve equations or perform math for you.

- No graphs or charts. Most graphs and charts are images. Lucid Math cannot interpret them; you’ll need to rely on alt text or captions.


## How to Toggle the Extension On and Off

Lucid Math does not have a built-in toggle switch.

However, you can enable or disable it at any time through your browser’s extensions page:

1. Go to your browser’s extensions/add-ons page.

2. Find Lucid Math.

3. Use the toggle to disable or re-enable it.

This lets you turn the extension off without uninstalling it.
