Math on the web is usually rendered using MathML, a markup language for structuring mathematical notation. While this works well visually, it creates serious accessibility challenges for screen reader users.

The problem is that the interaction is mostly one-way:

- You can hear the math spoken aloud, but copying or interacting with it is either impossible or depends heavily on screen reader features.

- Even if you manage to copy something, you often just get the raw MathML markup — which is not useful for solving problems.

This leads to frustrating consequences:

- You can’t easily copy equations to work through them step by step.

- If your answer is wrong, it’s difficult to retrace your steps and find the mistake.

- The process is slow, error-prone, and discouraging for anyone trying to learn math online with a screen reader.

## Enter Lucid Math

Lucid Math is a browser extension that scans web pages for MathML and converts it into plain, readable math text.

With Lucid Math:

- You can copy equations directly as plain text.

- You can read them word by word or character by character with your screen reader, just like any other text.

- You can solve problems step by step on your notepad, with the ability to retrace and debug your work just like a sighted learner.

This reduces mental load, removes the need to manually transcribe spoken math, and helps restore the natural flow of learning.

## Tested with real resources

Lucid Math has been tested extensively with:

- [OpenStax Prealgebra,](https://openstax.org/details/books/prealgebra-2e) a free and detailed math textbook.

- [Khan Academy,](https://khanacademy.org) where interactive problems become easier to read and solve.

## Why it matters

Learning math should be about understanding concepts and practicing problems — not about wrestling with inaccessible formats.

Lucid Math aims to give screen reader users the same freedom sighted learners have: to copy, read, and solve math naturally.

I hope this extension helps you on your mathematical journey.

Happy learning, and good luck!
